# CreativeCodingFinal
This project was my final for my Creative Coding Practices and Techniques Class. 
We were tasked with making an interactive creative program. 
We worked in some html, and mostly javascript along with P5.js as our main library that we were using, and the one that I used in this project. 
It was supposed to be representative of something, and was to show creative techniques through some sort of coding.
My project "Your Unique Life" is an audio and visual performance that represents the choices and events in life, and the randomness and uniqueness of everyone's life experience. Written in javascript and using the P5.js library, there are oscillators, looped audio files, and other audio inputs that are affected by the visuals on the screen and the pseudo-randomness that changes these visuals. The user can attempt to change the current life that is represented on the canvas and in the audio. 
You can interact with it in the following ways:
- Click to begin the animation. Click again to stop it.
- Move your mouse on the screen up and down to change the pitch of the background chorus, represented by the wave in the graphic.
- Hit spacebar to hit the snare drum and to display some stars. 
- Press 'B' to keep the trail of all of the animated shapes in the background, and hit it again to have them removed.
- Hold the left or right arrow keys to change the pitch and color of the 'Heart' circle, which is the constant oscillator that you hear. 
- Speak into your speaker to increase the animation speed.
- Press 'D' to end the animation, and kill the program...
